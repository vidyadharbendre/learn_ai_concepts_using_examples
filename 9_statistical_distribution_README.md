# Statistical Distributions

Statistical distributions are mathematical functions that describe the likelihood of obtaining the possible values that a random variable can take. They play a crucial role in statistics, data analysis, and probability theory.

## Types of Statistical Distributions

### 1. Discrete Distributions
- **Definition**: Discrete distributions are used for discrete random variables, which can take on a countable number of values.
- **Examples**:
  - **Binomial Distribution**: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of trials.
  - **Poisson Distribution**: Models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space.

### 2. Continuous Distributions
- **Definition**: Continuous distributions are used for continuous random variables, which can take on an infinite number of values.
- **Examples**:
  - **Normal Distribution**: A bell-shaped distribution defined by its mean and standard deviation.
  - **Exponential Distribution**: Models the time until an event occurs in a Poisson process.

## Key Concepts

### Probability Density Function (PDF)
A function that describes the likelihood of a random variable taking on a specific value.

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
A function that describes the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value.

## Central Limit Theorem
The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the population's distribution.
